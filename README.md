# Boba Shop Finder - Sunset District

## Description
I wanted to build a React project that I would use if it were an actual website since I like to drink milk tea. This project challenged me since I'm new to React but I'm proud of myself for making a decent looking site.

#### WORK IN PROGRESS
* Plans to add more boba shops as the list is incomplete.
* Plans to make it for phones responsive.

## How to Use
1. Goto the Github Pages I currently have the boba shop finder on [here](https://matthewwei35.github.io/boba-shop-finder/#/).
2. You can look at some boba shops and click on the pictures to get more details.
3. There is also an about page that tells you what what boba is.
